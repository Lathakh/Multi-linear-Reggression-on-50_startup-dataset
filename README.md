# Multi-linear-Reggression-on-50_startup-dataset
I have taken 50_Startup data  in order to work with multilinear regression algorithm.first step is collecting the dataset that data is not in customised form in order to apply machine learning algorithm so i  have done data preprocessing  in that there is no null value.Then go with  label encoding once done that ,see the correlation between input as well as output because main problem with multi-colliniarity in this algorithm.split train and test data seperatly and from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression model then got accuracy of 95%.
